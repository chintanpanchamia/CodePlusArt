### Description
WolfClock was created for Code+Art competition organized by NC State Libraries.
The idea originated on creating a good submission for the competition, over one weekend.
Displaying current date and time on a big screen, might not be innovative, but is informative.
We tried to bring some WolfPack spririt into the visualization with packs of wolves wandering in the background.
The packs have different types of wolves, and they follow the Alpha leader, in order, like a real pack.
